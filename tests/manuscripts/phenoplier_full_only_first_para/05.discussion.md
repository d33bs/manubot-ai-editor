## Discussion

We have introduced a novel computational strategy that integrates statistical associations from TWAS with groups of genes (gene modules) that have similar expression patterns across the same cell types.
Our key innovation is that we project gene-trait associations through a latent representation derived not strictly from measures of normal tissue but also from cell types under a variety of stimuli and at various developmental stages.
This improves interpretation by going beyond statistical associations to infer cell type-specific features of complex phenotypes.
Our approach can identify disease-relevant cell types from summary statistics, and several disease-associated gene modules were replicated in eMERGE.
Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that our gene module-based approach can prioritize causal genes even when single gene associations are not detected.
We interpret these findings with an omnigenic perspective of "core" and "peripheral" genes, suggesting that the approach can identify genes that directly affect the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes and thus prioritize alternative and potentially more attractive therapeutic targets.
