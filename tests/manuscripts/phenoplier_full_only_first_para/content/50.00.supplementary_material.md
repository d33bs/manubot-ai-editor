### Supplementary Note 1: mean type I error rates and calibration of LV-based regression model {#sm:reg:null_sim}

We assessed our GLS model type I error rates (proportion of $p$-values below 0.05) and calibration using a null model of random traits and genotype data from 1000 Genomes Phase III.
We selected 312 individuals with European ancestry, and then analyzed 1,000 traits drawn from a standard normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.
We ran all the standard procedures for the TWAS approaches (S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan), including:
1) a standard GWAS using linear regression under an additive genetic model,
2) different GWAS processing steps, including harmonization and imputation procedures as defined in [@doi:10.1002/gepi.22346],
3) S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan analyses.
Below we provide details for each of these steps.
