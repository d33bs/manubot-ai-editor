### LVs predict drug-disease pairs better than single genes

We next determined how substituting LVs for individual genes predicted known treatment-disease relationships.
For this, we used the transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations profiled in LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], which were further processed and mapped to DrugBank IDs [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1068; @doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47223].
Based on an established drug repurposing strategy that matches reversed transcriptome patterns between genes and drug-induced perturbations [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.3002648; @doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.3001318], we adopted a previously described framework that uses imputed transcriptomes from TWAS to prioritize drug candidates [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
For this, we computed a drug-disease score by calculating the negative dot product between the $z$-scores for a disease (from TWAS) and the $z$-scores for a drug (from LINCS) across sets of genes of different sizes (see [Methods](#sec:methods:drug)).
Therefore, a large score for a drug-disease pair indicated that higher (lower) predicted expression values of disease-associated genes are down (up)-regulated by the drug, thus predicting a potential treatment.
Similarly, for the LV-based approach, we estimated how pharmacological perturbations affected the gene module activity by projecting expression profiles of drugs into our latent representation (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b).
We used a manually-curated gold standard set of drug-disease medical indications [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47664] for 322 drugs across 53 diseases to evaluate the prediction performance.
