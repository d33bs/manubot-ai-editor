### PhenoPLIER: an integration framework based on gene co-expression patterns

PhenoPLIER is a flexible computational framework that combines gene-trait and gene-drug associations with gene modules expressed in specific contexts (Figure {@fig:entire_process}a).
The approach uses a latent representation (with latent variables or LVs representing gene modules) derived from a large gene expression compendium (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b, top) to integrate TWAS with drug-induced transcriptional responses (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b, middle) for a joint analysis.
The approach consists in three main components (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b, bottom, see [Methods](#sec:methods)):
1) an LV-based regression model to compute an association between an LV and a trait,
2) a clustering framework to learn groups of traits with shared transcriptomic properties,
and 3) an LV-based drug repurposing approach that links diseases to potential treatments.
We performed extensive simulations for our regression model ([Supplementary Note 1](#sm:reg:null_sim)) and clustering framework ([Supplementary Note 2](#sm:clustering:null_sim)) to ensure proper calibration and expected results under a model of no association.
