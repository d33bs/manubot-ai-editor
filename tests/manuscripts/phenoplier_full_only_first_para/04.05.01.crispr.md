### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

Our first experiment attempted to answer whether genes in a disease-relevant LV could represent potential therapeutic targets.
For this, the first step was to obtain a set of genes strongly associated with a phenotype of interest.
Therefore, we performed a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 in the HepG2 cell line and identified 462 genes associated with lipid regulation ([Methods](#sec:methods:crispr)).
From these, we selected two high-confidence gene sets that either caused a decrease or increase of lipids:
a lipids-decreasing gene-set with eight genes: *BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*;
and a lipids-increasing gene-set with six genes: *ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR* (Supplementary Data 2).
