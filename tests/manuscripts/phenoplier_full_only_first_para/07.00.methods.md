## Methods {#sec:methods}

PhenoPLIER is a framework that combines different computational approaches to integrate gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses with groups of functionally-related genes (referred to as gene modules or latent variables/LVs).
Gene-trait associations are computed using the PrediXcan family of methods, whereas latent variables are inferred by the MultiPLIER models applied on large gene expression compendia.
PhenoPLIER provides
1) a regression model to compute an LV-trait association,
2) a consensus clustering approach applied to the latent space to learn shared and distinct transcriptomic properties between traits, and
3) an interpretable, LV-based drug repurposing framework.
We provide the details of these methods below.
