### LVs reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

We used the projection of gene-trait associations into the latent space to find groups of clusters linked by the same transcriptional processes.
Since individual clustering algorithms have different biases (i.e., assumptions about the data structure), we designed a consensus clustering framework that combines solutions or partitions of traits generated by different methods ([Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
Consensus or ensemble approaches have been recommended to avoid several pitfalls when performing cluster analysis on biological data [@doi:10.1126/scisignal.aad1932].
Since diversity in the ensemble is crucial for these methods, we generated different data versions which were processed using different methods with varying sets of parameters (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}a).
Then, a consensus function combines the ensemble into a consolidated solution, which has been shown to outperform any individual member of the ensemble [@Strehl2002; @doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113].
Our clustering pipeline generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions (Figure @fig:sup:clustering:agreement).
The number of clusters of these partitions (between 5 to 29) was learned from the data by selecting the partitions with the largest agreement with the ensemble [@Strehl2002].
Instead of selecting one of these final solutions with a specific number of clusters, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to examine stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions.
To understand which latent variables differentiated the group of traits, we trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}b, see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
